# WorldNews - News Web Application using NodeJS EJS and newsapi.org

Initialize the Project

To initialise a Node.js project all you have to do is to create a new project folder “MyNews” and then run the Command line or PowerShell in the same directory.
Once you do that to initialise a new project simply put the following command : npm install 

This will initialise the project and it’s going to ask you a few questions about the project. 
The most important one is to give the project a name and then you can just keep pressing enter until the installation is over.
